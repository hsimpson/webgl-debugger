Electron:
✔ Could not be closed on Linux, no close button (reproducable on i3->X11 or sway->wayland) @done(20-01-14 23:23)
☐ Add app icon

Main process:
  ☐ Add react devtools extension
    - this only works when https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/19468 is fixed
  ☐ Add electron-reload to reload main process
   
  Render process:

    Themes:
      ☐ Global handling of theme change: e.g. when using it as a state in shader.tsx

    Styles:
      ✔ Flex Layout is not correct @done(20-01-01 02:03)

    Shader Editor:
      ☐ Improve syntax highlighting
      ☐ Handle code change
      ☐ Show diff when code has changed
      ☐ Roll back to original code
      ☐ Validate code (via glslangValidator, maybe as native electron plugin)
      ☐ Copy code button

    Buffer View:
      ☐ Guess buffer view layout from gl.vertexAttribPointer() call
      ☐ Layout of precision and buffer layout drop down
      ☐ Table layout
      ☐ Mesh preview
      ☐ Mesh export (GLTF, OBJ, STL, ...)

    Texture View:
      ✔ Render image to keep aspect ratio @done(20-01-08 00:00)
      ✔ Zoom Image to fit into viewport @done(20-01-07 23:58)
      ✔ Zoom control @done(20-01-14 23:24)
      ✔ Pixel cursor: which shows RGBA values (maybe in different formats: 0-255, 0.0-1.0, 0-100%) @done(20-01-11 01:29)
    
    Settings View:
      ☐ Configure action/mouse button to pan in texture view (maybe no middle mousebutton is available)
    
    WebGL Window:
      ☐ Serialize the 'texImage2D' and probably other calls which could take a HTMLImageElement to data buffer via canvas
      ☐ Handle closing of the WebGL Window
      ✔ Handle of open/close dev tools @done(20-01-10 21:04)
      ✔ @critical do not send WebGL objects like WebGLShader through IPC (e.g. in a call of gl.shaderSource(...)) @done(20-02-17 23:05)
        - Electron 8.x changes IPC serializing to "Structured Clone" algorithm and throw deprication warning
        - Electron 9.x throw an exception when there is a non serializable object like WebGLShader or any other opaque WebGL object
        ✔ Also check if typed arrays are transfered correctly with the new "Structed Clone" algorithm @done(20-02-17 23:05)

Build system:
  ☐ Github CI

  WebPack:
    ☐ Packaging electron-packager
    ☐ Unit tests (Jest)
    ☐ Electron test (Spectron)
    ☐ Improve import paths
    ☐ Try to generate fontawsome icons out of bundle, as svg
    ✔ Add webpack bundle analyzer in dev build @done(20-01-16 01:45)

React:
  ☐ Add react-router
