  Main process:

  Render process:

    Themes:
      ☐ Global handling of theme change: e.g. when using it as a state in shader.tsx

    Styles:
      ✔ Flex Layout is not correct @done(20-01-01 02:03)

    Shader Editor:
      ☐ Improve syntax highlighting
      ☐ Handle code change
      ☐ Show diff when code has changed
      ☐ Roll back to original code
      ☐ Validate code
      ☐ Copy code button

    Buffer View:
      ☐ Guess buffer view layout from gl.vertexAttribPointer() call
      ☐ Layout of precision and buffer layout drop down
      ☐ Table layout

    Texture View:
    
    WebGL Window:
    ☐ Serialize the 'texImage2D' and probably other calls which could take a HTMLImageElement to data buffer via canvas
    ☐ Ability to open/close dev tools
    ☐ Handle closing of the WebGL Window
    ☐ Handle of open/close dev tools

Build system:
  ☐ Packaging

React:
  ☐ Class components: instead of using "public readonly state" use a this.setState() call in the constructor
